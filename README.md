# RoadSafety_UK

This Jupyter Notebook has been divided into three large chapters. The first module, called "The dataset is my friend", contains a general but careful analysis of the proposed dataset. It contains an analysis divided mainly into two parts: a first study related to the data in general (called "A look at the data"; with graphs, statistics, possible reasons behind the results obtained...) and a second study from a time only point of view (called "Time flies").

The second module, called "Junction fever" is a thorough study of some of the UK's most famous roundabouts and road intersections. The study starts from a BBC article (the link is available at the beginning of the chapter) which presents a research carried out on 500 motorists about "the road intersection that most frightens the British". The aim of this study was to find and discover any characteristics and peculiarities of these junctions, as well as investigating a possible correlation between "sense of fear" and actual danger.

The last chapter is instead perfectly described by its title: Time travelling without a DeLorean collects and summarizes several predictive methods we have used to prevent the severity of future road accidents, with a range of information available.

This notebook is part of a university work, project done with other students. I have entered here only the part edited by me.
